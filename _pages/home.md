# Short Biography

<span class="small">Mohamed A. Salem is an assistant professor of electrical engineering at [Sonoma State University](https://sonoma.edu/), [School of Science and Technology](https://scitech.sonoma.edu/), [Department of Engineering](https://ee.sonoma.edu/). He directs the [Electrodynamics Engineering Laboratory](/Lab) (eel), where he investigates engineering the interaction between matter and the electromagnettic field. His earliest work studied the radiation and scattering behavior of propagation-inavriant beams and pulses, and established new methods for generating such waves. His subsequent work devised new semi-analytical and numerical methods for solving scattering problems in the presence of dielectric and metamaterial canonical shapes. His later work investigated engineering two-dimensional metamaterials, called metasurfaces, to independently control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of scattered waves. His latest work investigates applying machine learning techniques, such as surrogate models, neural networks, and support vector machines, in electromagnetic inverse-design. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2009, and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, and in Polytechnique Montreal in Quebec, Canada.</span>
