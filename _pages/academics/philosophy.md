# Statement

As an engineer and educator, it is my responsibility to challenge and support my students in pursuit of two goals:

1. learn rigorous and methodic approaches to tackle engineering problems;
2. cultivate an interest in leaving a positive impact on society and nature.

# Philosophy

<dl>
<dt>Cultivate interest and curiosity</dt>
<dd>The most important message to convey to the student is to be curious about the subject. A student who is interested and curious benefits the most from class, thus it is my responsibility to actively demonstrate the relevance and approachability of the subject in order to engage the students. By showing the elegance and beauty of the subject, as well as its applicability to solving real-world problems, I aim to nurture the latent desire to learn of the students.</dd>
<dt>Teach rigorously and methodically</dt>
<dd>It is also of importance to teach the students how to approach the subject, especially if it requires certain advanced cognitive skills. Topics related to wave propagation do essentially require a high level of abstract thinking and heavily rely on solid mathematical skills as well as creative problem-solving techniques. It is thus my responsibility to furnish the students with the necessary tools and proper systematic methodologies to approach the subject.</dd>
<dt>Actively engage students in class</dt>
<dd>From my experience, I know that students learn best when they engage several senses in the learning process. Hence, active participation in class, linking theoretical concepts to practical experiments (including thought experiments), and making connections with real-life applications are an integral part of my teaching methodology.</dd>
<dt>Adopt integrated and interdisciplinary approach</dt>
<dd>Presenting the learning material in conjunction with its relevant connections to other disciplines greatly helps putting knowledge in perspective and expand students' horizons. Such approach helps the students stay motivated and discover potential new interests. Moreover, I aim to design my course material to encourage the students to transcend the boundaries of isolated subjects.</dd>
<dt>Provide favorable learning environment</dt>
<dd>Education is a two-way street. The interaction with students, their comments about their progress, and their feedback about class are essential for improving the learning atmosphere. Taking corrective measures based on feedback helps students learn effectively and helps me design productive courses. Additionally, I would take advantage of state-of-the-art teaching tools and assessment methods to achieve this goal.</dd>
<dt>Build character and sense of professional responsibility</dt>
<dd>I believe that it is an integral part of any teacher's work to build character and sense of community in students. Among the qualities I strive to instill in my students are respect, trustworthiness, responsibility, fairness, diligence, and integrity.</dd>
